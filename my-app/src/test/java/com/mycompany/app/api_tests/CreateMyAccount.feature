# Vulnerability: Exposure of Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
# Issue: The log entry at [9:29:21 AM] contains the PII 'email' field with the value 'a@zb.io'
# Solution: To address this issue, sensitive information should be encrypted or anonymized in logs to prevent exposure. Additionally, implement access controls to restrict access to logs containing PII.

# Vulnerability: Exposure of Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
# Issue: The log entry at [11:01:09 AM] contains the PII 'name' field with the value 'dr'
# Solution: Similar to the previous issue, sensitive information should be encrypted or anonymized in logs to prevent exposure. Implement access controls to restrict access to logs containing PII.
# 
# Vulnerability: Lack of Data Encryption for PII
# Issue: Multiple log entries contain unencrypted PII, including email addresses and names
# Solution: Implement data encryption for PII within logs and ensure that access controls are in place to restrict access to sensitive information.
