# Vulnerability: Exposed API Token
# Issue: The log entry reveals the presence of an API token in the 'authorization' header at line 2 and line 4.
# Solution: The API token should not be exposed in logs. It's recommended to review the logging configuration to ensure sensitive information such as API tokens are not logged. Additionally, consider using environment variables or secure configuration management for handling API tokens.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR Non-Compliance - PII
# Issue: The log entry may contain personal identifiable information (PII) as it includes user-agent information, which can potentially reveal details about the user's device and browser. This is present in the 'header' section at line 2 and line 4.
# Solution: To ensure GDPR compliance, avoid logging user-agent information. Review the logging configuration to exclude PII from the logs to minimize the risk of exposure.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR Non-Compliance - Network Information
# Issue: The log entry includes host information, which may expose network details that are not intended for public exposure. This is present in the 'header' section at line 2 and line 4.
# Solution: To comply with GDPR principles, avoid logging network information such as host details. Review the logging configuration to ensure that network information is not logged.
